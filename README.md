### Pomodoro

A task-lister application that breaks tasks up into 25-minute pomodoro segments.

Users can create a to-do list. Each item in their to-do list can be split up into any number of pomodoros (25-minute tasks).

When a single pomodoro is selected, a timer is displayed. The timer will run for 25 minutes, and the user can then set a five minute break timer.
